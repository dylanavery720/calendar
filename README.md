# calendar

This application takes an array of objects from an API containing a users schedule, and converts it into a calender.

## usage

To fire up the application just clone down this repo, then `npm install`, and `npm start`. Then head over to `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/` and check out the calendar!
